# Investment_and_trading_Project
This Is My Previous Project I have done 

# project flow

1)We will have a meeting with the customer to discuss their requirements. The delivery manager will hold another meeting to ensure a better understanding of the requirements.

2)The product owner or scrum master creates an epic for the requirements and then creates user stories and tasks in Jira. Jira is a project management tool that contains information about the customer requirements, test plan templates, and sprint times.

3)After analyzing the requirements, I communicate my understanding to the development and testing teams, thus transferring knowledge to my colleagues and juniors.

4)During the development phase of the requirement, I utilize any free time or zero sprint time to identify test scenarios, write test cases, and create a traceability matrix. I then review my test cases with the team lead during a brainstorming meeting.

5)Once the requirement is developed and deployed to the testing server by the team lead, it can be tested thoroughly.



# 1-front end of the application
----------------------------------

As a software tester, my approach to testing involves the following steps:

1)First, the team lead provides me with the link to the testing server that we are testing.

2)Once I log in with my username and password, I navigate to the home page.

3)As a manual tester, I focus on usability, authorization, and other relevant areas, testing for any issues that may impact the user experience.

4)If I'm testing the application as a buyer, I begin by opening the enter quote page and testing all the fields on the page to ensure that everything is functioning as expected. This is an example of functional testing.

5)Next, I enter the quote and check the notification tab to verify that the quote has been properly processed. This is an example of integration testing.

6)From the login page to the final module, followed by logout, I perform system testing to ensure that all the different components of the application work together seamlessly.

7)As part of my testing process, I perform smoke testing, which is like a health checkup of the build. By identifying and reporting any defects early on, I help my team deliver high-quality products within a short timeframe. This has earned me recognition from my colleagues and team members.

8)Whenever I have time, I conduct regression testing to ensure that new features don't interfere with existing ones, and I enter any defects into our defect management tool (RDT) or Jira.

9)To test the application's performance under stress, I enter a large number of addresses and accept all offers, testing for any performance issues that may arise. This is an example of load testing.

10)To test the application's compatibility with different browsers, I use a variety of browsers to ensure that the application works well across different platforms.

11)When dealing with complex requirements, I conduct exploratory testing to gain a deeper understanding of the application.
If I encounter an error, I check the server log and database log, and I attach screenshots of the issue when entering the defect into our tracking system.


# 2-middle layer of the application
-----------------------------------------
1)Here we had the db we used PGAdmin for this here we use to verify the all details of user and validate the required filled which should be fullfil the ordered quote requirment or segment requirement.

2)Here we can also chechk the odered details and at what time the defect we got also we can check.

troubleshoot issues, and documented them in the bug tracking
system.

#Conducted exploratory testing to uncover additional defects
and improve the overall quality of the platform.

#Participated in daily stand-up meetings to discuss project
progress, identify risks, and plan testing activities.

#Communicated test results and status updates to project
stakeholders, including the project manager, development
team, and clients.

#Utilized tools such as JIRA, Selenium, to enhance the efficiency
